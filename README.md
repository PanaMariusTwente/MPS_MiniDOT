# MPS_MiniDOT

To run a graph example after cloning the repository, right-click on, and rebuild, the 'MiniDOT' language, and press right click on the sandbox "Graph" file to "Preview Generated Text" (or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F9).

Use the "DOT support" plugin (verified for v1.4.5) to visualize the textual graph (in MPS), or copy-pase the generated text in an online application like Graphviz.

To make or modify a custom graph, change "Sandbox\sandbox@0\Graph" within MPS.
